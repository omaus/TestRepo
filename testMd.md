# Annotated Research Contexts specification

Annotated Research Contexts ARCs are designed to represent FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) for plant science to facilitate encompassing Research Data Management (RDM) tasks. 

The [ARC-specification](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specfication/blob/main/ARC%20specification.md) provides a detailed description of technical requirements to form the basis for the operational characteristics.
